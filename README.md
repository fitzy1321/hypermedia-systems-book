# Hypermedia Systems Book Code

I bought the book "Hypermedia Systems" by Carson Bross, Adam Stepinski, and. Deniz Aksimsek.

The code within uses python and flask. I want to try out golang, so lets follow along, but with golang and a server framework.

How about builtin http server and templates? I've read articles, claiming a SWE could make a golang sever with the builtin http and templates package. Let's try it out.

## Dev Notes
